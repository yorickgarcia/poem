leaving the comfort of windows to the desktop, gaming with friends.
the server runs it too for easy plexing
the pi collection fufills my desire to run linux
this laptop fills outs that range with bigsur macos, 
new architecture with m1
we leave bash for zsh
i setup my rosetta terminal
the writting experience continue to feel great
i had to dig to find amethyst the window snapper again
i'm glad i don't have those butteryfly switches and touchbar gimmicks
